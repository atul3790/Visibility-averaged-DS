# Visibility-averaged-DS
This is a package which takes in calibrated measurement set and a background sky model, and generate visibility averaged dynamic spectrum for the central source after subtracting the visibilities of the background sky model. 
The package has three codes. One is a prep code which prepares the CASA measurement set data to be passed to the dynamic spectrum making code, then the dynamic spectrum (DS) making code and finally the plotter code which stiches together theoutputs from DS making code to generate 1 single plot for the entire observing period.the
